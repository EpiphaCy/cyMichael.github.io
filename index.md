<img class="profile-picture" src="self.jpg">

Hi, I'm Xisen Jin. I am a senior(4th) year undergraduate student in Fudan University, China, majored in Computer Science and Technology.

## Research Interest

My research interests mainly lie on Natural Language Processing. My current research focus is dialogue systems. 

> While dialogue systems are easy to start with, it is almost an ultimate goal of natural language processing. These efforts may push us towards this ultimate goal.
> - Infusing world facts or domain knowledge into dialogue generation, or in reverse, disentangle structural knowledge from them.
> - Structual modeling of grammar, discourse relationships and dialogue process in human interactions in unsupervised or semi-supervised fashion.
>
> And I am on the way of these explorations and have some publications on these areas. [Publications](#publications)
